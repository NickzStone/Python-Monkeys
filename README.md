Infinite-Monkeys

The Infinite Monkey Theorem describes a thought experiment wherein an infinite amount of monkeys
typing on typewriters for an infinite amount of time will eventually write any given text. This
is represented here by taking a user-generated goal string and 'typing' random characters until
a random string of characters happens to match the goal string.
